The key results are:\n    1. XAI methods are mainly used by ML engineers / designers for debugging.\n    2. Limitations of the methods are often unclear to those using it.\n    3. The goal og why XAI is used in the first place is often unclear or not well defined, which could potentially lead to using the wrong method.\n3. L. H.
