Unlike traditional prompt engineering, context engineering encompasses the complete information payload provided to LLMs at inference time, including all structured informational components necessary for plausible task completion.\n\nThis repository serves as a comprehensive survey of context engineering techniques, methodologies, and applications.\n\n---",
